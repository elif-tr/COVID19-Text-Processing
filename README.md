# COVID19-Text-Processing

This folder includes my work for processing Json files that are avaliable in https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge

The goal of the initial state is to extract papers that are published in a give time frame, read in those papers and analyze the sentences in these papers that include one or more of the Covid symptoms.

This is an ongoing project and the final findings will be published once completed.
